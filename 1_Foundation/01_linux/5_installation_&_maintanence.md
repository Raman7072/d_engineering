## 📦 Package Management

### APT – For Debian/Ubuntu

> **Q: What is the primary role of APT in Ubuntu/Debian?**  
> APT installs, updates, and removes software via trusted repositories.

```bash
sudo apt update           # Refresh package list
sudo apt upgrade          # Upgrade all packages
sudo apt install pkg      # Install new package
sudo apt remove pkg       # Remove a package
sudo apt autoremove       # Clean unused dependencies
````

### Snap – Universal Packaging

> **Q: What is a key advantage of Snap?**
> Snap apps are self-contained and auto-updating, working across distros.

```bash
sudo snap install spotify
sudo snap remove spotify
snap list                 # List installed snaps
```

## 📁 Filesystem Utilities

### silversearcher-ag (ag)

> **Q: How does silversearcher-ag differ from grep?**
> `ag` is faster, optimized for code, and respects `.gitignore`.

```bash
ag "TODO"
ag "function_name" --type js
```

### tree

```bash
sudo apt install tree
tree -L 2                 # Show directory tree 2 levels deep
```

---

## 🌐 Internet Utilities

### curl – HTTP Requests

```bash
curl https://example.com                # Fetch HTML
curl -O https://example.com/file.zip   # Download file
curl -X POST -d '{"key":"value"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.example.com
```

### wget – File Downloads

> **Q: When to prefer wget over curl?**
> Use wget for downloading large or recursive file sets.

```bash
wget https://example.com/file.zip
wget -r -l1 https://example.com/images/  # Recursively download
```

---

## 🔎 JSON Processing with jq

> **Q: What command-line tool is specifically designed for processing JSON data?**
> `jq` is the go-to tool for parsing and transforming JSON.

```bash
echo '{"name": "Alice"}' | jq .name
curl -s https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 | jq .title
```

---

## 📊 System Monitoring

### fastfetch – System Info with Flair

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fastfetch-project/fastfetch
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fastfetch
fastfetch
```

### btop – Resource Monitor

> **Q: What is the purpose of btop?**
> `btop` provides real-time resource usage graphs and process details.

```bash
sudo apt install btop
btop  # Press 'q' to quit
```
