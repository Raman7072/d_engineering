## 🧰 Text Editors vs IDEs

| Tool Type | Best For | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Command-Line Editors** | Server-side editing, fast keyboard navigation | `vim`, `neovim` |
| **Visual Editors** | Intuitive UI, extensions, syntax highlighting | `VS Code`, `Sublime Text` |
| **IDEs** | Large projects, debugging, advanced features | `JetBrains IDEs`, `Eclipse` |

### ✨ Editor Highlights

- **Vim**: Modal, efficient, steep learning curve.
- **Neovim**: Modern Vim with better plugin support.
- **VS Code**: Free, extensible, built-in Git/terminal/debugging.
- **Sublime Text**: Fast, clean UI, strong plugin ecosystem.
- **JetBrains IDEs**: Advanced language-specific tools (e.g., PyCharm, IntelliJ).
- **Eclipse**: Java-focused, highly extensible, open-source.

> **Q: When to use an IDE over a text editor?**  
> **A:** Use an IDE for complex, enterprise-level projects or when you need advanced debugging, refactoring, and project management tools.

## 💻 Customizing Your Linux Desktop

### 🌓 Light/Dark Mode
- **Why?**: Reduces eye strain (dark mode) or enhances visibility in bright settings (light mode).
- **How?**:  
  - GNOME: Settings → Appearance  
  - Xfce: Settings → Appearance/Window Manager  
  - KDE: System Settings → Global Theme

### 🧩 Workspaces
- **Why?**: Organize tasks into multiple desktops (e.g., code, browser, comms).
- **How?**: Use `Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Keys` or desktop-specific shortcuts.

## ⚙️ Pre-configured Environment: Omakube

**Omakube** offers a fully functional Linux dev environment out-of-the-box — NeoVim, Git, Node.js, Python, and more.

> **Q: Why is Omakube beneficial for beginners?**  
> **A:** Saves setup time, avoids errors, ensures a consistent learning environment.

> **Q: Any drawbacks?**  
> **A:** Less control/understanding of system internals, harder troubleshooting outside the pre-set environment.
