# Git Challenges at Scale and Alternatives

Git is powerful and widely adopted, but it was not designed for every use case. As companies grow, they face challenges with Git‚Äôs scalability, performance, access control, and usability. Below is a breakdown of these challenges, real-world examples, and the solutions companies have adopted.

---

## 1. Git Struggles at Scale
- **Background**: Git was built in 2005 for the Linux kernel. It works well for most open-source and web projects.
- **Scalability Issues**:
  - Repositories with **millions of files**  
  - Managing **very large binaries**  
  - **Thousands of developers** working simultaneously  

### üîπ Real-World Example: **Facebook**
- Problem: Git became **too slow** for Facebook‚Äôs large **monorepo**.  
  - Operations like branch switching and file history lookup were sluggish.  
- Solution: Built **Sapling**, a Git-compatible, scalable VCS optimized for speed.  
  - Reduced some workflows from **10 minutes ‚Üí seconds**.

**Alternative Tools**:
- **Sapling (Meta)**
- **Perforce Helix Core** (used by NVIDIA, Unreal Engine, game studios)

---

## 2. Git‚Äôs Performance with Large Files
- **Optimized for**: Code/text files.  
- **Problems with**: Large binary files (e.g., textures, videos, ML models, design assets).  
  - Small changes in binaries cause Git to store whole new copies.  
  - Git struggles to track and store them efficiently.  

### üîπ Real-World Example: **Epic Games / Unreal Engine**
- Uses **Perforce Helix Core** for managing large binary assets.  
- Benefits:
  - Better handling of **art/media workflows**  
  - **File locking** and **change tracking** support  

**Why not Git?**
- Git lacks **native file locking**  
- **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** helps but adds complexity  

**Alternative Tools**:
- **Perforce** (industry standard in AAA games)  
- **Plastic SCM** (popular in Unity-based development)

---

## 3. Access Control & File Locking
- **Git‚Äôs Model**: Fully distributed ‚Üí every developer has complete repo access.  
- **Limitations**:
  - Hard to enforce **fine-grained permissions**  
  - No native **file locking**  
- Needed in:
  - **Enterprise environments**  
  - **Game development**  
  - **Shared design asset workflows**  

### üîπ Real-World Example: **NVIDIA**
- Uses **Perforce** for:
  - **Strict permission control**  
  - **File locking** to prevent conflicts  
- Reason: Git‚Äôs distributed model doesn‚Äôt suit high-security requirements.  

**Alternative Tools**:
- **Perforce** (centralized with access control)  
- **SVN (Subversion)** (still used in some enterprises/legacy systems)

---

## 4. Git‚Äôs Learning Curve
- **Strength**: Git is extremely flexible.  
- **Weakness**: Steep learning curve for new users.  
- Common struggles:
  - Accidental commit loss (via reset/rebase)  
  - Merge conflicts (hard to resolve)  
  - Confusing terminology (HEAD, detached state, etc.)  

### üîπ Real-World Example: Startups Using **Mercurial or JJ**
- **Mercurial**: Simpler commands, more beginner-friendly.  
- **JJ (Just Journaled)**: Built by ex-Google engineers.  
  - **Git-compatible** but with clearer workflows and simplified history.  
  - Reduces number of steps in operations.  

**Alternative Tools**:
- **Mercurial** ‚Äî simpler distributed VCS  
- **JJ** ‚Äî modern, Git-compatible UX
