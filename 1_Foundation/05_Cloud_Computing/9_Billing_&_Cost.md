## ⚡ AWS Pay–Per–Use Model — Why It’s Tricky
Your bill may include **multiple hidden costs** for just one service:

- **EC2** → Compute time  
- **EBS** → Volumes & Snapshots  
- **Data Transfer**  
- **Elastic IPs**  
- **CloudWatch** → Logs & Metrics  
- **NAT Gateways / Load Balancers**  

**Reality:** A single service can generate **10+ line items**. Costs depend on **time, quantity, and frequency** of use.
