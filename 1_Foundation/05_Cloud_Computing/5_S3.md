# Amazon S3 — Your Unlimited Online Drive

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud storage service provided by AWS. It is widely used for storing, backing up, and delivering data globally.

---

## Why Use S3?

- **Unlimited storage**: Store any number of files.
- **Automatic backups & replication**: High durability and reliability.
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for what you store (no wastage).
- **Global access**: Access files securely from anywhere.
- **Used by industry leaders**: Netflix, Airbnb, Dropbox, etc.
- **Supports multiple use cases**: Logos, app images, backups, static websites, etc.

---

## How S3 Works

Think of S3 like a **locker room**:

- **Buckets** → Your personal lockers (must have unique names).
- **Objects** → The files you store (images, PDFs, backups, etc.).
- **Keys** → Unique identifiers (like file paths/names).

### Features:
- **Redundant storage** → Files are replicated across facilities.
- **Versioning** (optional) → Prevents accidental overwrites.
- **Access control** → Public or private settings per file.

---

## Why S3 is Affordable

- **Cold storage**: Data “sits quietly” until accessed.
- **Highly optimized infrastructure**: Efficient Amazon systems.
- **Different storage classes**: Pay less for rarely accessed data.

## S3 Storage Classes

| Storage Class          | Use Case                        | Cost     | Speed                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| Standard               | Daily use                      | High     | Fast                 |
| Intelligent-Tiering    | Mixed access patterns           | Medium   | Fast                 |
| Infrequent Access (IA) | Occasionally accessed data      | Low      | Fast                 |
| Glacier                | Rarely accessed archives        | Very Low | Slow (minutes-hours) |
| Deep Glacier           | Old logs, compliance data       | Lowest   | Very Slow (hours)    |

👉 **Lifecycle Policies** automate movement between classes:  
- After 30 days → Move to IA  
- After 90 days → Move to Glacier  
- After 365 days → Delete

## Buckets — The Core of S3

- **Unique name** (e.g., `my-bucket-2025`)
- **Region-specific**
- **Supports versioning**
- **Custom permissions & policies**

Inside buckets, you can:  
- Upload files manually  
- Organize with folder-like paths  
- Host a static website  

---

## Using S3 with the Command Line (AWS CLI)

```bash
# Create a bucket
aws s3 mb s3://my-cool-bucket

# Upload a file
aws s3 cp hello.png s3://my-cool-bucket/

# List files in a bucket
aws s3 ls s3://my-cool-bucket/

# Delete a file
aws s3 rm s3://my-cool-bucket/hello.png
```
✅ Useful for automation, backups, and deployments.

---

## Bucket Access & Security
- **Bucket Policy** → JSON-based permissions at bucket level.
- **IAM Policies** → User/role-based access control.
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** → Legacy, rarely used.
### Example Rules:
- Allow public access only for `images/**`.
- Restrict uploads to a specific EC2 server.
- Avoid accidental public buckets to prevent data leaks.

    A[Amazon S3] --> B[Buckets]
    B --> C[Objects (Files: images, docs, backups)]
    C --> D[Storage Classes]

    D --> D1[Standard: Daily use, Fast, High Cost]
    D --> D2[Intelligent-Tiering: Mixed, Medium Cost]
    D --> D3[Infrequent Access: Rare use, Low Cost]
    D --> D4[Glacier: Archives, Very Low Cost, Slow]
    D --> D5[Deep Glacier: Old data, Lowest Cost, Very Slow]

    C --> E[Lifecycle Policies]
    E --> E1[30 days → Move to Infrequent Access]
    E --> E2[90 days → Move to Glacier]
    E --> E3[365 days → Delete]

    B --> F[Access Control]

    F --> F2[IAM Policies (User/Role access)]
    F --> F3[ACLs (Legacy permissions)]

    B --> G[Static Website Hosting]
    B --> H[CLI Commands for Automation]
```


👉 This diagram shows:  
- **Buckets contain Objects**  
- **Objects are stored in different Storage Classes**  
- **Lifecycle Policies move data automatically**  
- **Access is controlled via Policies/ACLs**  
- **Buckets can also host websites & be managed via CLI**  

Do you want me to also add a **real-world example architecture diagram** (like how Netflix or a personal app would use S3 with EC2, CloudFront, and IAM)?

## Exercise — Try it Yourself
1. Create a new **S3 bucket**.
2. Upload an **image/PDF**.
3. Make it **publicly viewable**.
4. Open in a **browser** → live on the web!
5. Delete it, then repeat using **AWS CLI**.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- **S3 = Scalable, Secure, Simple** cloud storage.
- **Buckets & Objects** form the core structure.
- **Storage Classes & Lifecycle Policies** save money.
- **Security & Access Control** are critical.
- **CLI tools** make automation easy.
